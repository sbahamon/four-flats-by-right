            <p class="intro-paragraph">Chicago is facing a housing crisis. Many people cannot afford to live in the neighborhoods they prefer, near jobs and transit. We need more housing options for Chicago families, young professionals, and seniors.</p>
            
            <p>We, the undersigned organizations and individuals, are calling on the City of Chicago to re-legalize the construction of four-flat buildings in all neighborhoods across Chicago.</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <p>Four-flats would:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create more affordable housing through increased supply</li>
                    <li>Allow for sustainable development near transit</li>
                    <li>Revitalize communities with appropriate-scale housing</li>
                    <li>Create more diverse, inclusive neighborhoods</li>
                    <li>Generate tax revenue to fund city services</li>

            </div>
            
            <p>Four-flats are a traditional Chicago housing type that has provided affordable, family-sized homes for generations. Yet today, our zoning code prohibits building them in many neighborhoods, limiting housing supply and contributing to our affordability crisis.</p>

                    <p>Four-flats are a traditional Chicago housing type that has existed in our neighborhoods for over a century. They can be designed to match existing architectural styles and fit seamlessly into our communities. Many existing four-flats would not be legal to build today!</p>

                    <p>Four-flats near transit reduce car dependency. Studies show that households near train stations own fewer cars. Modern zoning can require appropriate parking solutions when needed.</p>
